\title{Make population}
\usage{
make_pop(species, max_age, nM, fM, n_init)
}
\arguments{
\item{species}{Species for which population dynamics will be simulated.
Choices include American shad (\code{"AMS"}), alewife (\code{"ALE"}), and
blueback herring (\code{"BBH"}).}

\item{max_age}{The maximum age of fish in the population(s). A numeric vector of length 1.}

\item{nM}{Instantaneous natural mortality rate. 
A numeric vector of length for (\code{"AMS"} or a vector of 
length \code{max_age} for \code{"ALE"} and \code{"BBH"}.}

\item{fM}{Instantaneous fishing mortality rate. 
A numeric vector of length 1.}

\item{n_init}{Initial population abundance (includes all age classes).}
}
\value{
A vector containing age-specific abundances 
with \code{length = max_age}.
}
\description{
Function used to seed initial age-structured
population for simulation based on life-history
characteristics. Uses an initial population seed, mortality
estimates, and maximum age to create a starting population.

\examples{
# Example usage
\dontrun{
  
# Simulate a fish population at stable age distribution
  pop = make_pop(max_age, nM, fM, n_init)
