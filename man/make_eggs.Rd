\title{Simulate number of eggs per fish}
\usage{
make_eggs(river, species = c("AMS", "ALE", "BBH"), custom_habitat = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{river}{The river for which eggs will be simulated.}

\item{species}{Species for which population dynamics will be simulated.
Choices include American shad (\code{"AMS"}), alewife (\code{"ALE"}), and
blueback herring (\code{"BBH"}).}

\item{custom_habitat}{A dataframe containing columns corresponding to the
those in the output from \code{\link{custom_habitat_template}}. The default,
\code{NULL} uses the default habitat data set for a given combination of
\code{species} and \code{river}.}
}
\value{
A vector containing age-specific potential annual 
fecundity with \code{length = max_age}.
}
\description{
Function used to simulate number of eggs 
produced per female (potential annual fecundity, PAF),
for rivers included in \code{\link{get_rivers}}.
}
\section{Details}{

The default method for American shad uses predictive equations from Olney and
McBride (2003) to simulate batch fecundity from weight-fecundity relationships
using coefficients in \code{\link{olney_mcbride}} for the life-history region
corresponding to the specified river. Number of batches for this
approach is currently drawn from a random normal distribution
with a mean of 6.7 and a standard deviation of 2.1 (McBride et al. 2016).

The default method for river herring calls \code{\link{make_eggs_rh}} with
simulation methods and references described therein.
